# Last thoughts

I've been very sick, so I haven't been able to make the app as extensive as I would have liked.
I'd like to still
* Add venues as a table
* Add a one-to-many venue-to-event relationship
* Make some aggregate functions that could arise from that relationship
* Add filtering by location/venue/time/gernre/etc.

## Normalization

I simply didn't have the energy to normalize the database. It works fine enough at the moment :pensive:
