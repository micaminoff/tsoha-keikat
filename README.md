# tsoha-keikat

## Description
**tsoha-keikat** is my project for the course [Tietokantasovellus-harjoitusty√∂](https://materiaalit.github.io/tsoha-20/).

The app is hosted on [heroku](https://tsoha-keikat.herokuapp.com/).

The basic idea behind the app is to list shows with info about performer, venue, and date.

#### Current state of the app

* Event Table exists
* Users Table exists
* All events have an account reference
* Editing and deletion is restricted to the creator of an event
* Postgres running on Heroku
* CRUD functionality for the Events table
* Logging in and signing up works (even as admin!)

#### Future state of app
The app will
* Allow sorting by time/place/performer
* Allow searches by time/place/performer
* Admin rights for modifying/deleting events
